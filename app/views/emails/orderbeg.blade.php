	<h2>Hi {{{$user->name}}},</h2>
	<p>
		Summer holidays are fast approaching - and with it the last grocery card order of the year. 
		<b><a href="https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/edit">Order extra cards</a> before midnight on Tuesday, May 26th to make sure you have plenty for the summer.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	The Grocery Card Fairies are taking the summer off, but we'll be back in September. All regular orders will be suspended for the summer. 
	We'll let you know when you can reactivate so you don't miss an order.
	</p>
