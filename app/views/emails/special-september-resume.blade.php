<p>You can also resume your order at <a href="https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/Resume">https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/Resume</a>.
This will reactivate your account. You can then make changes or edit your order as needed. It is easy. 

<p>(Forgot your password? Don't worry you can reset it when you log in.)</p>

<p>The first order deadline is Sept 1st.  Your cards will be mailed out or ready for pick up at the NWS Wednesday Sept 9th between 8-8:30am or 2:30 - 3pm at 
the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>Last year we raised over $40,000 without spending any extra money! It is amazing what we can accomplish when we work together.  
Resume your order now so we can get started for this year.</p>

<p>No longer at the school? Considering maintaining your support for the Tuition Reduction Fund or another class. 
Class 8 would love your support for their graduating year. Remember, it doesn't cost you anything.</p>

<p>If you have any questions send me an email at <a href="mailtto:grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org">grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org</a>.

	<p>Thank you for your support,<br/>
	Snow Colbeck & the Grocery Card Fairies</p>
