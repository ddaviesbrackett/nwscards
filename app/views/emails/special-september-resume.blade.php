	<h2>Hi {{{$user->name}}},</h2>

<p>This is a friendly reminder to resume your grocery card order so you can start raising money for the school and the classes! (If you already resumed - hooray!)</p>

<p>We had 38 orders the first week and would like to keep this number growing.</p>

<p>Please press this button to get your cards again:
<a style="display:block;margin:3em auto;padding:1em;text-align:center;max-width:25em;color:White;background-color:#a40016;border-radius:5px;" 
href="https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/email-resume?uid={{{$user->id}}}}&code={{{$user->reactivation_code}}}"><span style="font-size:2em;">Resume My Order</span></a>
<p>You can also resume your order at <a href="https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/Resume">https://grocerycards.nelsonwaldorf.org/Resume</a>.
This will reactivate your account. You can then make changes or edit your order as needed. It is easy. </p>

<p>(Forgot your password? Don't worry you can reset it when you log in.)</p>

<p>The order deadline for our next delivery is <b>today, Tuesday, Sept 15th</b>. </p>

<p>Last year we raised over $40,000 without spending any extra money! It is amazing what we can accomplish when we work together.  
Resume your order now so we can get started for this year.</p>

<p>No longer at the school? Considering maintaining your support for the Tuition Reduction Fund or another class. 
Class 8 would love your support for their graduating year. Remember, it doesn't cost you anything.</p>

<p>If you have any questions send me an email at <a href="mailto:grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org">grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org</a>.

	<p>Thank you for your support,<br/>
	The Grocery Card Fairies</p>
