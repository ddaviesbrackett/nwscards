		<p>
       	I authorize the Nelson Waldorf School Parent Association (hereinafter “PAC”) to make pre-authorized debits (PAD) from my account with the aforementioned 
       	financial institution, either:
       	<ul>
	       	<li>bi-weekly, commencing on {{{$dates['biweekly']['charge']}}} and ending on September 5, 2017</li>
	       	<li>monthly, commencing on {{{$dates['monthly']['charge']}}} and ending on September 5, 2017</li>
       	</ul>
       as selected on the order form on my account page at grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org. 
       <p>This is a variable PAD: For each withdrawal my account will be debited for the total amount on my order form (recurring order plus any one-time order) as ordered for each scheduled order at grocerycards@nelsonwaldorf.org. I agreed that PC may reduce the standard period of pre-notification for variable amount PADs. PC will send me notice of the amount of each PAD at least 4 calendar days before the PAD is due. </p>
       	<p>
       	Each withdrawal will correspond to a fixed amount equal to the total stated on the order form.  
       	I understand my account will be debited two business days before the published delivery dates for my order frequency. 
       	</p>
       	<p>Type of Pre-Authorized Debit: PERSONAL </p>
